## 🔑 Keylogger Simulation in C

This is a basic keylogger **simulation** program written in **C** for educational purposes. It reads character input from the user and logs each keystroke to a file (`log.txt`). The project is safe to run in Android environments like **Cxxdroid** and does not capture system-wide keystrokes.

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is for educational use only. Do not use keyloggers without clear permission. Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical.

## 🚀 Features
- Logs each character typed by the user.
- Ends logging when `#` is typed.
- Saves keystrokes to a file (`log.txt`).
- Works in **Cxxdroid** (Android C IDE).

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
1. Run the program.
2. Type characters on the keyboard.
3. Type `#` to end the session.
4. The file `log.txt` will contain all logged characters, one per line.

## 📂 Output Example
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e55f44cd-05d3-46b7-a79f-01bd52e29b65)
If you type:
Hello123#
Then `log.txt` will contain:
H e l l o 1 2 3

## 📱 Running on Cxxdroid

1. Install [Cxxdroid] from the Play Store.
2. Paste the code into a new project.
3. Run the code.
4. Access `log.txt` from the internal storage or file manager in Cxxdroid.
